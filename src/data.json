At 2.5 years old, Rihaan's fascination with loud music at a village wedding foreshadowed behaviors that would perplex his parents.",

Despite living with extended family, support was scarce, leaving his parents feeling isolated. Challenges compounded daily, hindering their interactions with neighbors who struggled to comprehend Rihaan's behavior.",

Despite previous negative reactions to Rihaan's diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Mild Intellectual Disability, the center provided a beacon of hope. Empathetic teachers embraced Rihaan, offering tailored therapies and support, easing his parents' frustrations. Despite its modest surroundings, the center provided comprehensive services and connected them with experts in child development and disabilities.",

Using reward-based techniques, the team tackled Rihaan's behaviors, fostering his focus on studies and independent living skills. Encouraged to interact with neighborhood children, Rihaan developed vital social skills",

Despite occasional feelings of helplessness, they draw strength from knowing they're not alone in navigating the challenges of parenting their exceptional son."

                    "Nishat ( name changed ) was born in her native village in Uttar Pradesh. She contracted double pneumonia at birth which resulted in convulsions and later an inability to walk. When she was about 6 yrs old, her family decided to migrate to Mumbai for better treatment. Nishat’s brother Mansur, a year older than her, had the same neurological disorder as her. Before they could move to Mumbai, the father had a fatal accident",
                    "Mustering tremendous courage, Nishat's mother came to Mumbai and rented a small room for herself, Nishat, and Mansur in Narayan Nagar in Ghatkopar which was closer to her maternal home. Treatment and therapy was sought for both children. With therapy and medication, Nishat began walking by the age of seven. Her seizures too were brought under control. The mother enrolled Nishat in a local private school and the school authorities were supportive.",
                    "In 2013, Nishat and her mother faced a second blow when Mansur fell ill and succumbed to his illness. Nishat was devastated since she was close to her brother. Her disability was becoming severe and more visible. She was losing control over her movements and her speech began to slur. Friends started avoiding her and she became an object of ridicule in her school. This prompted her mother to discontinue her schooling from Std.7 but it proved to be a huge setback for Nishat who enjoyed studies. In 2015, when Nishat’s mother took up a part-time job as a Child Health Worker in Sahyog’s Sankalp project (on early childhood development and disability) she would lock Nishat in the house when she left for work, to protect her from ridicule and harassment by neighbors. To minimise Nishat’s isolated existence, having her attend Sangharsh a couple of days a week was suggested to the mother—and she agreed. At Sangharsh, Nishat began to meet and interact with peers/children her age. Sahyog began to support expenses for medicines that were prescribed by a pediatric neurologist to control her seizures and tremors. She began coming to Sangharsh regularly and liked being with other children. Nishat’s mental health began improving. Her confidence returned and she started going out and interacting with people. She participated enthusiastically in Sangharsh’s Annual Day performance, and spoke in front of an audience. Her mother began to ask her to do household chores like buying provisions from the market.",
                    "In the meantime, a vocational training centre was identified for Nishat to encourage her in her journey towards independence. She along with another Sangharsh student visited the centre regularly accompanied by a community volunteer. However, as the training centre was unable to offer her tasks to match her abilities, she stopped going.",
                    "Nishat repeatedly expressed the desire to study and appear for the Std.10 Board exam. A search for a tutor was kept up till a suitable one was found. In August 2016, a young college student from a nearby community was identified and she took on the challenge to tutor Nishat who was returning to studies after gap of more than 3 years. Nishat continued receiving support and encouragement at Sangharsh during this trying period. The daughter of one of Sangharsh’s volunteers offered to be her writer for the board examination and spent time with Nishat in solving exam papers as part of the preparation. Nishat’s persistence, determination as well as the faith, support and encouragement from those who believed in her yielded results and she cleared the SSC examination in 2017 with 54%.",
                    "Since 3rd of July 2017 she has been enrolled at ADAPT Skill Development Centre. Here, she is enrolled in a vocational class and during the week also participates in a variety of activities: yoga, dance therapy and computers. She is also working towards her next goal which is preparing for the Std. 12 Board exam. Her mother has been offered a full time job at the centre in the tailoring unit and so mother and daughter set out for work together. With the determination that Nishat has, we are as confident as her that she will make an independent life for herself—with a little help from friends and well-wishers."

A 2012 survey of 500 households in Ashok Nagar, Kaju Pada, revealed a significant number of young adults aged 13 to 20 with various disabilities who had little formal education or socialization. This highlighted the need for a Zero Rejection policy, ensuring that families lacking resources could still educate their children. Consequently, Sahyog Sangharsh became an accessible community center.",

Over a period of three years, setting up a welcoming library with attractive books, conducting book-based activities, and carrying out outreach activities succeeded in the community understanding the purpose of a library as well as recognising the value books brought to the lives of their children.",
                "The day a few parents removed prized objects from their sole showcase and replaced them with books, we dared to believe that we had carved a special space for books in their hearts. In 2016, when Sahyog took a tough decision to exit the Goregaon community, we left knowing that the children coming to Roshan had built a strong and joyful relationship with books and reading was much more than an academic chore.",
                "The work of Bookworm Trust in Goa has inspired us to expand the scope of our work in Ghatkopar by starting a mobile library and planning the library-in-school model.  The Roshan Library programme has taken root and is growing steadily."

Furthermore, having trained women professionals in the community fosters essential services and a progressive environment, inspiring more young women to embark on similar paths.",

Trainees also volunteered in Sahyog’s programs, gaining practical experience. Post-training, they were placed in NGOs for six months of hands-on experience. Through this journey, 200 girls completed their school-leaving exams, with about 100 transitioning to college. Many others pursued skills through various training courses, apprenticeships, and employment.",
